\usage{
powerShape(x, alpha, center = NULL,
    normalization = c("det", "trace", "one"), maxiter = 1e4, eps = 1e-6)

tylerShape(x, center = NULL,
    normalization = c("det", "trace", "one"), maxiter = 1e4, eps = 1e-6)

classicShape(x, center = NULL,
    normalization = c("det", "trace", "one"), maxiter = 1e4, eps = 1e-6)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric data matrix or data.frame without missing data.}

\item{alpha}{Tail index, a numeric value in the interval \code{[0, 1]}.
Determines the power function. For more information see 'Details'.}

\item{center}{An optional vector of the data's center, if \code{NULL} the center
will be estimated simultaneously with the shape.}

\item{normalization}{A string determining how the shape matrix is standardized.
The possible values are
\itemize{
\item{\code{'det'}}{such that the returned shape estimate has determinant 1.}
\item{\code{'trace'}}{such that the returned shape estimate has trace \code{ncol(x)}.}
\item{\code{'one'}}{such that the returned shape estimate's top left entry
(\code{S[1, 1]}) is 1.}
}}

\item{maxiter}{A positive integer, restricting the maximum number of iterations.}

\item{eps}{A numeric, specifying the tolerance level of when the iteration stops.}
}
\value{
A list with class 'shapeNA' containing the following components:
\item{S}{The estimated shape matrix.}
\item{scale}{The scale with which the shape matrix may be scaled to obtain
a scatter estimate. If \code{alpha} = 1, then this value is \code{NA}, as Tyler's
shape matrix has no natural scale.}
\item{mu}{The location parameter, either provided by the user or estimated.}
\item{alpha}{The tail index with which the Power M-estimator has been called.}
\item{naBlocks}{\code{NULL}, since \code{powerShape} operates only on complete data.}
\item{iterations}{Number of computed iterations before convergence.}
\item{call}{The matched call.}
}
\description{
Power M-estimators of shape and location were recently suggested in
Frahm et al. (2020). They have a tuning parameter \code{alpha} taking values in
\code{[0,1]}. The extreme case \code{alpha} = 1 corresponds to Tyler's shape
matrix and \code{alpha} = 0 to the classical covariance matrix. These special
cases have their own, more efficient functions \code{\link{tylerShape}} and
\code{\link{classicShape}}, respectively.
If the true location is known, it should be supplied as \code{center}, otherwise
it is estimated simultaneously with the shape.
}
\details{
These functions assume that the data were generated from an
elliptical distribution, for Tyler's estimate this can be relaxed to
generalized elliptical distributions.

For multivariate normally distributed data, \code{classicShape} is the maximum
likelihood estimator of location and scale. It is a special case of the
power M-estimator with tail index \code{alpha} = 0, which returns the empirical
covariance matrix and the empirical mean vector.

The function \code{tylerShape} maximizes the likelihood function after projecting
the observed data of each individual onto the unit hypersphere, in which case
we obtain an angular central Gaussian distribution. It is a special case of
the power M-estimator with tail index \code{alpha} = 1, which returns Tyler's
M-estimator of scatter and an affine equivariant multivariate median.

The function \code{powerShape} requires an additional parameter, the so-called
tail index \code{alpha}. For heavy tailed data, the index should be closer to 1,
for light tailed data the index should be chosen closer to 0.
