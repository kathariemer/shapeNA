\title{Reorder Data with Missing Values}
\usage{
naBlocks(x, cleanup = TRUE, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix with missing values.}

\item{cleanup}{A logical flag. If \code{TRUE}, observations with less than 2 responses
are discarded.}

\item{plot}{A logical flag. If true, a plot of the missingness pattern is produced.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{naBlocks} with components:
\item{x}{The reordered data matrix.}
\item{permutation}{The permutation of the columns which was applied to reorder the columns according to the number of \code{NA}s.}
\item{rowPermutation}{The permutation of the rows which generates the blocks.}
\item{N}{A vector of all row indices. Each row number points to the beginning of a new missingness pattern.}
\item{D}{A vector specifying the missingness pattern for each block.}
\item{P}{A vector specifying the number of observed variables per block.}
\item{kn}{A vector specifying the percentage of observed responses per variable.}
}
\description{
Reorder a data set with \code{NA} entries to form blocks of missing values. The
resulting data will have increasing missingness along the rows and along the
columns. The rows are ordered such that the first block consists of complete
observations, and the following blocks are ordered from most frequent
missingness pattern to least frequent missingness pattern.
}
\details{
In case of ties, that is two patterns occur with the same frequency, the block
whose pattern occurs first will be ordered in front of the other block.

This method may fail if the missingness is too strong or if the number of
observations is too low (the number of observations has to exceed the number
of variables), as it has been designed as a preprocessing step for shape
estimations.
