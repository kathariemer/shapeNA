Description: This package allows to compute power M-estimators for shape and location. 
    Power M-estimators generalize both the empirical covariance estimates and Tyler's 
    M-estimate of scatter. Methods for both complete data, as well as data with missing 
    values are supplied.
    Additionally, the package contains some basic plotting functions, which aid in 
    visualization of the results.
