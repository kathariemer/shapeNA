Description:  M-estimators of location and shape following the recently 
    suggested power family (Frahm, Nordhausen, Oja (2020) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2019.104569>) are provided in the case of complete data 
    and also when observations have missing values together with functions 
    aiding their visualization.
